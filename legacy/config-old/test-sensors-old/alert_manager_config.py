"""
Configuration for the Alert Manager.

This file centralizes all settings for the alert system, including SMTP server details,
API keys for other notification services, and the email addresses of recipients.
By using a dedicated configuration file, the alert manager becomes more modular,
easier to maintain, and less prone to errors from hardcoded values.
