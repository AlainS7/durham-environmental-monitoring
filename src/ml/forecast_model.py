"""
Machine Learning Model for the Hot Durham Project.

This module is responsible for all machine learning-related logic, such as air
quality forecasting, anomaly detection, and seasonal trend analysis. By
centralizing the ML models, it becomes easier to manage, extend, and integrate
with other components of the application.

Key Features:
- Air quality prediction.
- Anomaly detection.
- Seasonal trend analysis.
- Data quality scoring.
