"""
Alert Manager for the Hot Durham Project.

This module is responsible for handling all alert-related logic, such as checking
for unhealthy air quality levels, monitoring sensor health, and reporting data
collection failures. By centralizing the alert system, it becomes easier to
manage, extend, and integrate with other components of the application.

Key Features:
- Air quality threshold monitoring.
- Sensor health and malfunction detection.
- Data collection failure notifications.
